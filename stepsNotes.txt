In NodeJS
require('express')= CJS(Common JS)
import ('express')= ES (Ecma Script)

module.exports=functionName
exports.functionName



# Arrow Functions in JavaScript:
const sayHi = () => {
    console.log("Hello Brother");
}

# Normal Functions in JS
function sayHi(){
    console.log("Hello Brother");
}

Note1: when the html datas are passed inside the function then its called "Component" rather than a function.

Example:
function greet(){
    return{
        <h1>JoJoloppa</h1>
    }
}


Note2:
Problem 1:How to handle routes/path

*******************NOTE******************
Download this extension => "ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets"

Inside Home.jsx
// Shortcut to get this below by default is "rafce"


NOTE:
Component name should always start from Capital letter as it is conventional use


Problem During managements of Components:

As when the value is changed all the buttons values will change so to solve that Problem
-> We use Props
Example:
<Button title="Login" />

means:
//variable Declarations:
const props={
    title:"Login",
    subTitle:"Register"
}
props.title  -> to access the value Login
props.subTitle  -> to access the value Register
